			" [[open-paragraph]] Creating mosaics with dice can be an exciting and rewarding art form. The size of the dice you choose can greatly affect your final design. Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of using different sized dice.  ",

			"[[highlight]] 1. 16mm Dice [[highlight]] [[break]] Larger dice, such as 16mm, offer a bold and striking appearance. Their size allows for greater visibility and makes them stand out in larger mosaic projects. ",

			"[[highlight]] 3. 8mm Dice [[highlight]] [[break]] Smaller 8mm dice can add a high level of detail and intricacy to your mosaic projects. They are ideal for creating fine designs or patterns where every piece counts. Their size allows for more pieces in a given area, enabling complex arrangements.",
